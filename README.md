# Grid Pathfinding and Dynamic Replanning

This project implements several grid-based pathfinding algorithms (Breadth-First Search, A*) and a dynamic replanning strategy for an autonomous agent navigating a grid environment.
The project includes visualization of the agent's path and supports user-defined dynamic obstacles.
